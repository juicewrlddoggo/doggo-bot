# doggo-bot

an open-source remake of a closed-source project i did before, an all-in-one discord bot!
the original project was made to be a bleed killer, but i decided against it because those less fortunate may not be able to afford the bot.
this is a way of making the project open-source and free for everyone, however, donations are greatly appreciated and motivates me to continue and improve the project.
